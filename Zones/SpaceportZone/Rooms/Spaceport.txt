Spaceport
4
A bustling outdoor spaceport area, near the landing pads for spaceships.
Stacks of magnetic shipping crates stick to the floors in awkward places, bits
of junk and pieces of food from the spaceport's restaurant float by, and dozens
of travelers and workers tromp around in magnetic boots.
