Lucy's Spaceport Restaurant
8
There are restaurant tables and chairs all around, and most of them seem occupied.
A sign suspended over the restaurant reads "Lucy's Space Fare".

This place seems to be fairly popular. Near the bottom of each ladder is a podium
with a sign that says "Please wait to be seated." If you remove your space helmet
you'll detect a strong odor of spices and garlic, the result of an overworked air
circulation system. Above you is the thin force field holding in the smell, through
which you can see the brightness of the galaxy stretching across the sky.
