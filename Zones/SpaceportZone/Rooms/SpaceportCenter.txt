Spaceport Center
5
As central as this area is to the spaceport, it is surprisingly nondescript.
There is a huge, gaping hole in the middle with ladders all around it, and what
looks like a film-thin force field holding air inside the area below. At the
bottom it looks like there are tables and chairs, and people sitting comfortably
at them in artificial gravity.
